# loop deck function

#### By Todd Pangilinan

Just a homework assignment to create a loop within a loop to build a deck of cards.

## Technologies used:

* JavaScript
* markdown

## Description:


Just a javascript function exercise to show how to put a loop within a loop. I set up two arrays (one for cards- ie, king, queen, jack, 10, etc), and one for suit. I set up a loop within a loop to concatinate the contents and pushed it to a new array.

No html or input, just wanted to pracitice with Javascript, git, and READMEs.


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* cut and past the function into a console and run it. It should console log the full deck of cards.##
